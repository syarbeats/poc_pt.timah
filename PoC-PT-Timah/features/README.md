# Features
This project creates a features definition that can be used to easily install the example.

## How it works?
Using Maven's resource filtering mechanism, we replace the `${xyz.version}` tokens in the `src/main/resources/features.xml` file.
Afterwards, the resulting file is published as a Maven artifact itself so you can use it from the Karaf console with

`karaf@root> features:addurl mvn:org.apache.servicemix.demo.camel-jms-jdbc/features/2.0.0/xml/features`

Inside the features file, you'll find a definition for feature called `camel-jms-jdbc-demo`.
